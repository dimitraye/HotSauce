# Hot Sauce #

This is the front end and back end server for Project 6 of the Web Developer path.

### Back end Prerequisites ###

You will need to have Node and `npm` installed locally on your machine.
You need to create a folder called `Ã¬mages` inside the back folder
You need to create a file named ".env" inside the back folder that contains the database user info. For exemple :
    Replace XXX by the database user Id and user Password :
        DB_USER=XXX
        DB_PASSWORD=XXX
        

### Back end Installation ###

Clone this repo. From the "back" folder of the project, run `npm install`. You 
can then run the server with `node server`. 
The server should run on `localhost` with default port `3000`. If the
server runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the
console when the server starts, e.g. `Listening on port 3001`.
